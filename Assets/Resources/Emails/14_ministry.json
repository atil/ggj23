  "MessageBody": "Greetings,\n\nAs you might be aware, an investigation was being conducted against your organization by my colleague, officer Adam.\n\nUnfortunately, last night there has been a #FIRE at his residence and as an unfortunate result he was #BURNED to death.\n\nI took over the evidence he had gathered, and determined they were obviously forged, and he was trying to frame your organization for personal gains.\n\nThe investigation will be shut down at this point and law enforcement will cease pursuing this case."
