  "MessageBody": "Greetings,\n\nAs you know, an investigation was being conducted against your organization by my colleague, officer Adam.\n\nUnfortunately, last night there has been a #fire at his residence and as a result he was #burned to death.\n\nI took over the evidence he had gathered, and determined they were obviously forged, and he was trying to frame your organization for personal gains.\n\nThe investigation will be closed at this point and law enforcement will not pursue this any longer."
